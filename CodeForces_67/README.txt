	There is a game called "I Wanna Be the Guy", consisting of n levels. 
	Little X and his friend Little Y are addicted to the game. 
	Each of them wants to pass the whole game.

	Little X can pass only p levels of the game. 
	And Little Y can pass only q levels of the game. 
	You are given the indices of levels Little X can pass and the indices of levels Little Y can pass. 
	Will Little X and Little Y pass the whole game, if they cooperate each other?

	Input :
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤  n ≤ 100).

The next line contains an integer p (0 ≤ p ≤ n) at first, then follows p distinct integers a1, a2, ...,
ap (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). These integers denote the indices of levels Little X can pass. 
The next line contains the levels Little Y can pass in the same format. 
It's assumed that levels are numbered from 1 to n.

	Output : 
If they can pass all the levels, print "I become the guy.". 
If it's impossible, print "Oh, my keyboard!" (without the quotes).

	Examples :
input
4
3 1 2 3
2 2 4
output
I become the guy.
-------------------
input
4
3 1 2 3
2 2 3
output
Oh, my keyboard!
-------------------
	Note :
In the first sample, Little X can pass levels [1 2 3], and Little Y can pass level [2 4], 
so they can pass all the levels both.

In the second sample, no one can pass level 4.
